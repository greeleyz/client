                        <strong>The Maya Childcare Trust</strong> is a US Charity that was established on June 30 2011.
                        We aim to support the social, emotional, educational and physical
                        development of Guatemalan children living in poverty. The Trust does this by supporting the development of the ‘Centro Infantil Bellota’, a childcare project
                        in the city of Quetzaltenango
                    </p>

                        The project is based in an area that used to be part of the ancient Mayan empire.
                        Today there is a rich diversity of cultures within Guatemala and just over half the population identify themselves
                        as Mayan. Our support is offered to every ethnic group in the region and is based on need.
